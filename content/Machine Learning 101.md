## Types of machine learning 
- Supervised 
	- Classification 
	- Regression
- Unsupervised 
	- Clustering
	- Association 
- Reinforcement 
	- Skill acquisition
	- Real time learning 
## What is machine learning 
- The process of taking data into an algorithm or model to detect patters in order to predict future outcomes 
- Example of normal algorithm vs machine learning algorithm 
	- normal algorithm will get the ingredients and instructions to create the output
	- machine learning algorithms get the ingredients and the output, so it has to figure out what happened in between 
- Data analysis: analyzes and visualizes the data in order to find patterns and understand it better 
- Data science: running experiments to find actionable findings
