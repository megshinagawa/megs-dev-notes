- ADHD time tracking game
	- Helps people with ADHD who have time blindness 
	- You start a timer and do your task. Then you stop the timer and guess how much time has passed. (accuracy level tbd but probably to the closest minute)
	- Accumulates this data for future use 
	- Helps you see how "good" your perception of time is 
- Random workout picker (based on energy level)
	- Tackles decision fatigue 
	- You state what energy level you're at and it gives you back an appropriate exercise routine for that energy level 
	- You can choose how long you actually work out for so you're not forced to do more than you want BUT the tool will help you with deciding 
- Morning routine maker (personal assistant)
	- Greets you in the morning 
	- Asks you how you're doing and adds your response to your daily note 
	- Asks questions to get a gauge of what you need today and gives you your morning routine for the day
