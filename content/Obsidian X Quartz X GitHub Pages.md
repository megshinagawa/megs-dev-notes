## Purpose 
- To create a dynamic website that reflects my developer Obsidian vault so that I can share my learnings with the world. 
## Process 
- I mainly followed [Nicole Van Der Hoeven](https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/)'s video tutorial that I will like below in the resources section 
- I also read the official Quartz documentation to make sure I had all the commands correct, and that everything I was doing was up to date
## Resources 
- [Nicole's Quartz setup walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/6s6DT1yN4dw?si=AkVzZB9UJS7QzDWG)
- [Quart's official documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
