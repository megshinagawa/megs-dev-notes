## About this page 
---
Hey there! I'm Meg, and welcome to my developer notes page! This site is where I will be publishing my learnings and findings to the internet in order to practice "learning in public." I already have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmgNUsFzcte6qmsCLL429pg) where I share content on productivity and my life, but I wanted a dedicated place to consolidate my journey and findings as a developer. Hence, this page! 

This page is made using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). For more about how I did this, check out my notes about it here: [[Obsidian X Quartz X GitHub Pages]]. Otherwise, enjoy wandering the somewhat chaotic documentation of my personal developer journey :))
